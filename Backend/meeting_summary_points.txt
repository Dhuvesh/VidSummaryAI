===========================
-  API is usually developed by backend. We just get it. We start working on it. So what happens is when we start. working on front end, we don't usually have an API because API is handled by. backend team. What we need to do is we. need to create, pay API. We need to have some sort of links. We must have some kind of response. So we can test our front end project. That's where this whole JSON server coming to picture.
